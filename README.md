## Overview
Consuming `RESTful` `APIs` is one of the key skills that every front-end developer should have. After getting familiar with promises and asynchronous language, I decided I wanted to develop a project that involved consuming an `API` of my choice and letting the user interact with its information.<br></br> Since I played Pok√©mon a lot when I was a child ‚Äîmore specifically, **Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team**‚Äî I chose Pok√©API, a free `RESTful` `API` connected to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pok√©mon main game series: Pok√©mon names, their stats, their location areas, and so on!  
‚ö†Ô∏èI've always been fond of Pok√©mon up to the third generation, so the latest Pok√©mon that the user can retrieve data from is `Deoxys-Normal` (number 386).

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript ES6**

## Pok√©dex Features
### Overall behavior
When page loads, JavaScript fetches the first 386 Pok√©mon from `Pok√©API`, i.e, Pok√©mon up to generation III. Then, the retrieved Pok√©mon are stored in an array named `fetchedPokemons`.  
From this point, users can type and submit a Pok√©mon name within the mentioned range to obtain certain features about them. If the submitted name is wrong or doesn't exist, a warning message is shown.

### INPUT
Users are expected to submit a Pok√©mon name in the text input. Once done, data from that Pok√©mon is displayed on the page. The text input covers the following aspects:
- Text is automatically converted to upper case while typing.
- Users can submit the text both by pressing `Enter` or clicking on the `Search!` button.
- If users submit an invalid Pok√©mon name, i.e, a non-existent Pok√©mon or a misspelled name, an alert message is displayed. This also includes out-of-range Pok√©mon names like Piplup or Lucario.

### POK√âMON DATA
Not all data from the API is retrieved and shown to the user. Below are the following aspects covered in my Pok√©dex:
- Base Pok√©mon experience (a number).
- Pok√©mon ID (a number).
- All types of that Pok√©mon (a string). If the Pok√©mon belongs to more than one type, they are shown separated by commas.
- Pok√©mon weight in kilograms (a string). Since Pok√©API provides Pok√©mon weight in hectograms, they are converted to kilograms right before being displayed.
- Previous Pok√©mon on the Pok√©API (a string). **Important**: this is not actually the previous Pok√©mon in the standard order, but in the order used in the API.
- Next Pok√©mon on the Pok√©API (a string).
- Three random moves that Pok√©mon can learn. This was such a tricky part because while some Pok√©mon can learn plenty of moves, some others like Silcoon or Cascoon cannot. To achieve this, `Math.random()` was used in combination with `Math.floor()` to generate 3 random numbers every time a Pok√©mon is searched. Since the mathematical result is multiplied by the total number of that Pok√©mon available moves, a number bigger than their total available moves is never generated.

> There are only 5 moves available to Silcoon, each one of them assigned to an array index between 0 and 5.  
> Therefore, the lowest number randomly generated this way is 0 and the largest 5.

- If the searched Pok√©mon is Ditto, the only displayed move is the only one it can learn (transform).
